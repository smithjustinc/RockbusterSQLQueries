The following queries are used to identify and clean data in the Rockbuster Data Sets. The queries also include descriptive statistics of the data sets.

Queries:
Identifying duplicate data:
SELECT film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, last_update, special_features, fulltext FROM film GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 HAVING COUNT(*) >1
SELECT customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, activebool, create_date, last_update, active FROM customer GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 HAVING COUNT(*) >1

Identifying non-uniform data:
SELECT DISTINCT film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, last_update, special_features, fulltext FROM film
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, email, address_id, activebool, create_date, last_update, active FROM customer

Identifying missing data:
SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id = NULL OR title = NULL OR description = NULL OR release_year = NULL OR language_id = NULL OR rental_rate = NULL OR length = NULL OR replacement_cost = NULL OR last_update = NULL OR special_features = NULL OR fulltext = NULL
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer_id = NULL OR store_id = NULL OR first_name = NULL OR last_name = NULL OR email = NULL OR address_id = NULL OR activebool = NULL OR create_date = NULL OR last_update = NULL OR active = NULL
